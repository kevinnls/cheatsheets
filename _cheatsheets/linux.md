### What is Linux?
Linux is a kernel â€” the fundamental piece of software that manages
the hardware resources notably the CPU and RAM of a computer.

Every operating system has a kernel, and the applications that one
runs on a computer, including the operating system itself needs to
talk to the kernel to be able to use the hardware.

### Wait so then all the typing into keyboard hacker-y thing?
Popular misconception? ðŸ¤·

<!--say something about GUI vs CUI-->

On systems running a Linux kernel, the terminal often tends to be
the primary method of interaction.
